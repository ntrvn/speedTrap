# Speed Trap
## USC Intro to Embedded Systems - Final Project
Speed Trap is a device which measures how fast an object is moving as it passes two sensors and then relays that speed to a remote device. I built the circuit using an Arduino Uno, breadboard, LED screen, and phototransistors; enabled the transfer of bits to a remote device using a TTL/RS-232 converter; and implemented a rotary encoder and speaker and programmed the entire device in C.
